The Report-It Unchained API lets you do awesome stuff based on a repository of all Report-Its submitted to the City of Luxembourg's Report-It system. ðŸš€

### Reports

You can retrieve reports in three different ways:
- paginated and using filters (recommended)
- all at once (strongly discouraged)
- by ID

The `service` key of a report is inferred and a best guess based on the answers of that report, which inversely means that reports without answers do not have a value here.

Reports are enriched with meta data, such as the **language** (guessed using CLD2, `un` stands for unknown), reverse-geolocated **address data** of the report's location, and **all answers** given by the city.

You should **always** prefer the paginated endpoint over the endpoint that delivers all reports (ie a database dump), unless you **really** want to grab a complete copy of all the data at once.
If you do download the whole database, be warned that it may take some time to process your request.

### Photos

The photo endpoint allows you to download the photo relating to a given report ID.
